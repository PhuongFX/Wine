## `About`
> Clustering Connoisseurs is a machine learning project that uses a comprehensive dataset of 13 chemical constituents of wine to cluster wines into distinct categories.
> > The goal is to develop a system that can accurately classify wines based on their chemical profiles, and provide insights into the characteristics of different wine styles.

## `What's in this project?` 🫶

* A dataset comprising 13 chemical constituents of wine, captures the diverse chemical profiles of wines from the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
* Machine learning algorithms to classify wines into distinct categories based on their chemical constituents.
* Including interactive visualizations of the wine data to make it easy to explore and understand the relationships between different wine characteristics.
* Model evaluation using classification reports and accuracy scores
* Prediction of cluster assignment of new, unseen wine samples based on their chemical constituents.

## `How it Works` 🫶

We're using a combination of exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization to identify patterns and relationships in the wine data. 📈 It's like being a wine detective, searching for clues to uncover the secrets of the perfect wine! 🔍
