## `About`
> Clustering Connoisseurs is a machine learning project that uses a comprehensive dataset of 13 chemical constituents of wine to cluster wines into distinct categories.
> > The goal is to develop a system that can accurately classify wines based on their chemical profiles, and provide insights into the characteristics of different wine styles.
